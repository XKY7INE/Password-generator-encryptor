# Password-generator-encryptor
The internet world usually makes their users untrust it, this is boosted by the fact that their personal data can be exposed or filtered without their consent,
this mainly happens because of the lack of complexity of some passwords. Itâ€™s true that the user must be conscious about the web pages on which they provide 
their data, having that in mind, they assure their files are not being exposed by the same platform.
Because of these problems with insecure passwords XKY7INE was created.

# Purpose
As a free project, that the community is interested and participates by helping as a joint is the main objective of this activity.

# Vision
At XKY7INE what we are looking for is mainly a software that allows people to save their passwords by encrypting them, avoiding: data theft due to insecure passwords and the reuse of passwords in all their accounts. The method we seek to apply is through the use of a kind of keychain (the password generator) located on their devices where they can carry an encrypted list of their passwords.

# Mission
Offer the user a tool with which they can create, generate and encrypt passwords in a secure way. Mainly, we want to create a software that allows us a greater
range of customization focused on more secure passwords.
